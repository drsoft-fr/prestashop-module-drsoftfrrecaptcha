- update: Update reCAPTCHA handling and error management

          This significant update enriches the reCAPTCHA functionality of the application. It splits form submission and reCAPTCHA readiness into separate functions and enhances error handling by providing more detailed error messages. A new configuration interface for the reCAPTCHA functionality is also defined. Moreover, a preload-recaptcha script was added to ensure reCAPTCHA is ready before any actions are performed. The project's package version was updated to reflect these changes.;
